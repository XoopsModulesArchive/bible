Whaa?
	PHPScripture is a program written to fill a rather obvious (IMHO) need. Basically, this program allows anybody who has a PHP-enabled web server to serve a copy of the Word of God very, very quickly. While the user interface is nice for reading, it's designed expressly for a quick, easy way of sending passages of scripture to and fro, since the scripture reference is actually encoded in the URL, it is easy to send people a link to a passage without typing it in.

How?
	1) Upload the files to a useful place inside your web server's document tree.
	2) Change the things that look wrong in config.php.
	3) Make sure "AcceptPathInfo ON" (or analogous) is somewhere in your PHP file section of your web server config.
	4) Go over steps 2 and 3 again, because you probably missed something for lack of documentation.
	
	If you wish to use it as a plug-in for a PHP-based CMS system, you have my blessing to start hacking away. :)
	If you have troubles, check troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting
	Common Problem 1:
		Q) It's not working! Blah blah this happens, something, something else!
		A) This is most likely caused by you forgetting to change everything broken in config.php. If that's not the case, check Bugs below.
	
	Common Problem 2:
		Q) It's giving me a 404 every time I press a button or click a link on it!
		A) Either problem 1 applies, or your web server doesn't have path info enabled. (When using Apache, you might try "AcceptPathInfo ON" in your PHP file section.)
	
	Common Problem 3:
		Q) It tells me it can't find the book, even when I selected it from the list!
		A) Either problem 1 applies, or the program doesn't have access to (or can't find) the data files. Make sure all of the PHPScripture files have correct permissions with something like, "chmod 644 bible.php config.php bible/*;chmod 755 bible".

Bugs!!!
	Yes, even Christians are fallible, and my PHP coding is like an explosion in a pot of spaghetti. If you find an honest-to-goodness bug, check the Bugs section on http://bible.cyberMalex.com/.
